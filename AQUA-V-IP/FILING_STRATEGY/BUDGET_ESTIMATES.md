## Cost Optimisation Options

| Strategy | Potential Saving | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| Limit jurisdictions to US + EP only | −$35,000 | No CA/JP/KR protection |
| File C1.2 + C2.1 as divisionals of P0 PCT | −$15,000 | Narrower independent claims |
| Skip Phase 5 CIPs initially | −$110,000 | No aerospace-specific protection until later |
| Use in-house counsel for drafting | −$20,000 | Requires qualified patent attorney on staff |
| File EP without UK (use EP validation) | −$8,000 | UK protection only via EP patent |
