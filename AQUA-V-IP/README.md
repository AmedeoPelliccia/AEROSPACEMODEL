## The AQUA-V Equation

```
QAPD  +  QAOS  =  AQUA-V
```

| Component | Scope | Key Innovation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **QAPD** | Design-time | Hybrid GenAI–Quantum encoding with deterministic, auditable reproducibility |
| **QAOS** | Operations | Criticality-aware quantum/classical resource scheduling with digital twin sync |
| **AQUA-V** | End-to-end | Unified DEV → SSOT → Ops digital thread with formal evidence chain |

## Claim Layering Strategy

### Independent Claims (every application)
1. **Method** — A computer-implemented method for …
2. **System** — A system comprising processors, quantum processing units, memory, and instructions …
3. **Computer program product** — A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions …

### Dependent Claim Axes
- Aerospace application (BWB-H₂, LH₂ constraints)
- QAOA + classical fallback mechanism
- Evidence packaging tied to lifecycle phases (LC03–LC08)
- Workload classification (QW1–QW4) and scheduling
- Cryogenic material / structural constraints in QUBO encoding
- EASA / DO-178C traceability linkage

## Novelty Anchors

The portfolio novelty is grounded in **four pillars** that distinguish AQUA-V from prior art:

1. **Structured governed integration** — Not generic "quantum + AI"; a formally governed hybrid architecture with explicit BREX-rule-constrained transformations and contract-gated operations.
2. **Deterministic auditable mechanism** — Global seed + cryptographic hash of inputs + solver version = bit-reproducible quantum computation records, enabling certification audit trails.
3. **DEV–SSOT–Ops coupling with formal evidence** — Validated designs are promoted to a Single Source of Truth (SSOT) only after cryptographic evidence packaging; operational digital twins are synchronised from the same provenance record.
4. **Domain-specific hybrid discrete-continuous encoding for certified systems** — QUBO formulations include cryogenic temperature constraints, material compatibility matrices, and DAL-classified failure mode bounds — elements absent from generic QUBO literature.

## What NOT to Claim (Obviousness Risks)

| Topic | Reason to Avoid |
|-------|----------------|
| Generic "use of QAOA for combinatorial optimisation" | Extensively published; obvious extension of Farhi et al. 2014 |
| Generic "use of digital twin for engineering design" | NASA, Airbus, ESA all have prior art; no novel integration step |
| Generic "use of generative AI in engineering workflows" | Autodesk, Siemens, PTC all have extensive publications |
| "Quantum speedup for NP-hard aerospace problems" | Theoretical claim without demonstrated advantage → § 101 / Art. 52(1) risk |

## Filing Strategy Summary

**Recommended path (see `FILING_STRATEGY/STRATEGY.md` for full rationale):**

1. **Month 0** — US Provisional for P0 (establishes priority date for all children)
2. **Month 0–1** — US Provisionals for C1.2 + C2.1 (strongest novel claims)
3. **Month 12** — PCT application (P0 + C1.2 + C2.1 consolidated or separate)
4. **Month 30** — EP + US national phase entry
5. **Ongoing** — C3.x filed as continuation-in-part as BWB-H₂ technology matures

## Alignment with Repository Mission

The AEROSPACEMODEL repository provides:
> *"A European-governed digital continuity infrastructure enabling deterministic, traceable lifecycle transformations with explicit human oversight, fully aligned with EASA certification principles, GAIA-X data sovereignty, and the EU AI Act risk-based approach."*

The AQUA-V patent portfolio directly claims the novel technical mechanisms that implement this infrastructure, specifically:
- The **deterministic reproducibility** mechanism (C1.2)
- The **criticality-aware orchestration** layer (C2.1)
- The **cryptographic evidence ledger** that ties design decisions to certification artefacts (C2.3)
- The **hybrid QUBO encoding** that incorporates domain-specific aerospace constraints (C1.1, C3.1)
