# 28-22 — Insulated Transfer Lines (LH₂ Circular Cryogenic Cells)

**ATA Section:** 28-22
**System:** AMPEL360 Q100 — C2 Circular Cryogenic Cells
**Compliance:** S1000D Issue 5.0, CS-25 Special Conditions, ARP4754A, ARP4761

## Scope

This section covers the **insulated transfer lines** subsystem for liquid hydrogen (LH₂) circular cryogenic cells:

- Vacuum-insulated hydrogen distribution piping
- Cryogenic line materials (stainless steel, aluminium alloys)
- Line routing, supports, and thermal contraction accommodation
- Leak-tight connections and couplings

## Area of Responsibility

| Role | Stakeholder |
|------|-------------|
| Design authority | C2 Systems Team (STK_ENG) |
| Safety oversight | STK_SAF |
| Configuration management | STK_CM |

## Boundaries

- Upstream: GENESIS/ (uncertainty discovery layer)
- Downstream: Subject folders under `28-22-00-insulated-transfer-lines-general/`
- Interface: ATA 28-10 (storage), ATA 71 (fuel cell interface)
