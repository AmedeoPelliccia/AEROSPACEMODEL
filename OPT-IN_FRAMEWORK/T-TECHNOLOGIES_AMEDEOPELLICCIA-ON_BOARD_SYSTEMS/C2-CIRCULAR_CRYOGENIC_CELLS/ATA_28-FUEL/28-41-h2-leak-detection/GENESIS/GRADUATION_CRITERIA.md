# GENESIS Graduation Criteria — 28-41 H₂ Leak Detection (C2)

Rules for promoting GENESIS items (O-KNOTs and Y-KNOTs) to formal subject-level KNOTs.

## Graduation Requirements

A GENESIS item may be promoted to a subject KNOT when **all** of the following criteria are met:

1. **Uncertainty characterized** — The unknown is sufficiently understood to define scope, impact, and potential resolution approaches.
2. **Owner assigned** — A responsible stakeholder (individual or team) is designated.
3. **Closure plan defined** — A concrete plan with milestones exists for resolving the uncertainty.
4. **LC phase identified** — The target lifecycle phase for resolution is determined (typically LC03 or LC04).

## Approval Authority

| KNOT Type | Approval Authority | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Standard (non-safety) | STK_ENG | Engineering lead confirms characterization |
| Safety-related | STK_SAF | Safety board review required per SAFETY-H2-001 |

## Process

1. KNOT owner submits graduation request with evidence of criteria met.
2. Approval authority reviews and approves or returns for further work.
3. On approval, GENESIS item status is set to `graduated` and a subject KNOT is created in the ID_REGISTRY.
4. Traceability link is recorded in TRACE_MASTER.csv (KNOT → KNU).
