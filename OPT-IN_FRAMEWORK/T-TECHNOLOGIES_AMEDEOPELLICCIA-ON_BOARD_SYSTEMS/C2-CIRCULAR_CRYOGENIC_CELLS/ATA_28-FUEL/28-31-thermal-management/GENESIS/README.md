# GENESIS — Uncertainty Discovery Layer (28-31 Thermal Management)

**ATA Section:** 28-31
**Purpose:** Capture and manage uncertainties before they enter the formal lifecycle

## Overview

GENESIS is the **pre-lifecycle uncertainty discovery layer** for section 28-31 (Thermal Management). It captures unknowns that must be resolved before or during formal development.

## KNOT Types

### O-KNOTs (Origin Uncertainties)

Inherited or experience-gap uncertainties arising from the **novelty of C2 circular cryogenic cell technology**.

### Y-KNOTs (Derived Uncertainties)

Regulatory and requirement-driven unknowns from **SC-28-H2-001** and related special conditions.
