# GENESIS — Uncertainty Discovery Layer (28-10 Fuel Storage)

**ATA Section:** 28-10  
**Purpose:** Capture and manage uncertainties before they enter the formal lifecycle

## Overview

GENESIS is the **pre-lifecycle uncertainty discovery layer** for section 28-10 (Fuel Storage). It captures unknowns that must be resolved before or during formal development.

## KNOT Types

### O-KNOTs (Origin Uncertainties)

Inherited or experience-gap uncertainties arising from the **novelty of C2 circular cryogenic cell technology**:

- No prior flight heritage for circular-geometry LH₂ tanks
- Limited long-term data on MLI vacuum performance at scale
- Thermal cycling fatigue behaviour under operational profiles

### Y-KNOTs (Derived Uncertainties)

Regulatory and requirement-driven unknowns from **SC-28-H2-001** and related special conditions:

- Boil-off rate compliance pathways not yet defined
- Cryogenic material qualification criteria under CS-25 special conditions
- Hydrogen purity verification methods at tank interface
