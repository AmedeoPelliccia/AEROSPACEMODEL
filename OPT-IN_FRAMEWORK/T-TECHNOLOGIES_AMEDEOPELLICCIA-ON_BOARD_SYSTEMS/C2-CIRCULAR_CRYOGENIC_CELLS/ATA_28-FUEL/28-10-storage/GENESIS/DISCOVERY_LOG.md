## 2026-02-14 — Initial GENESIS Population

**Author:** STK_ENG (C2 Tank Team)  
**Action:** Initial population of GENESIS layer for C2 circular cryogenic cells.

**O-KNOTs created (3):**
- `C2-28-OKNOT-001` — Cryogenic insulation aging (MLI long-term performance)
- `C2-28-OKNOT-002` — Circular cell structural fatigue under cryo cycling
- `C2-28-OKNOT-003` — MLI vacuum degradation in operational environment

**Y-KNOTs created (3):**
- `C2-28-YKNOT-001` — Boil-off rate compliance pathway (SC-28-H2-001)
- `C2-28-YKNOT-002` — Cryogenic material qualification under CS-25 SC
- `C2-28-YKNOT-003` — Hydrogen purity verification at tank interface

**Rationale:** C2 circular cryogenic cell technology has no prior flight heritage. These KNOTs capture the primary uncertainties to be resolved during LC02–LC03.
