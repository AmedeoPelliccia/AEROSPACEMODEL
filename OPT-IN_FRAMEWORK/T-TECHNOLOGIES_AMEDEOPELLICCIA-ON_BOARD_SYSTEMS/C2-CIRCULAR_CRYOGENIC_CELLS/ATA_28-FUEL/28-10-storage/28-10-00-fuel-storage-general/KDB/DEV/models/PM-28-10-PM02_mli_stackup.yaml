objective: >
  Define the thermal stack-up model for vacuum-jacketed multi-layer
  insulation (MLI) on circular cryogenic cells.  Predict total heat
  leak as a function of layer count, installation density, vacuum level,
  boundary temperatures, and integration losses (seams and penetrations)
  to estimate boil-off and size insulation per TS-28-10-TS03 (Option A).

  - name: "Radiation heat flux (modified Lockheed MLI model)"
    expression: >
      q_rad = C_r * epsilon_eff * (T_h^4.67 - T_c^4.67) / N_layers

    notes: >
      Exponent 4.67 from Lockheed fit accounts for radiation + solid
      conduction coupling.

    expression: >
      q_cond = C_s * n_density^2.63 * (T_h - T_c) / N_layers
    unit: "W/m^2"

      n_density dependence captures contact pressure effect on

    notes: >
      Free-molecule regime conduction; linear in pressure.  Dominant
      only when P_vac > ~1E-4 torr.  This is a heat flux term (per
