objective: >
  Define the structural analysis model for cryogenic cell mounting and
  load paths.  The model evaluates vibration response, crash loads, and
  thermal cycling effects on the support structure to ensure compliance
  with CS 25.561 (emergency landing), CS 25.571 (fatigue and damage
  tolerance), and DO-160 vibration requirements while accommodating
  cryogenic thermal contraction.

    Combined load cases (LC-COMB-*) apply superposition of constituent
    cases.  Thermal pre-stress from LC-THERM-01 is added algebraically
    to crash inertia loads before margin evaluation.  The most
    conservative result (max principal stress or von Mises) governs.
