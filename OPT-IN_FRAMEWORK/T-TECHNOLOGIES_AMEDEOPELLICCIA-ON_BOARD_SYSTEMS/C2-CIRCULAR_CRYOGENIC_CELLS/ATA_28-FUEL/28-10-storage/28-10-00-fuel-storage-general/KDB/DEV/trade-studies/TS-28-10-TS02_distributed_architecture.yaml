objective: >
  Evaluate storage architectures for LH₂ fuel system comparing
  single-tank, dual-symmetric, and multi-cell distributed
  configurations for CG stability, redundancy, structural impact,
  and safety.

options:
  - id: A
    name: "Single Large Tank"
    description: "Single centrally located cryogenic tank"
    cg_stability: "Stable (central)"
    redundancy: "Low"
    structural_impact: "Heavy reinforcement"
    safety: "Medium"

  - id: B
    name: "Dual Symmetric Tanks"
    description: "Two symmetrically placed cryogenic tanks"
    cg_stability: "Very Good"
    redundancy: "Medium"
    structural_impact: "Balanced"
    safety: "Good"

  - id: C
    name: "Multi-Cell Distributed"
    description: "Multiple smaller circular cryogenic cells distributed across BWB"
    cg_stability: "Excellent"
    redundancy: "High"
    structural_impact: "Load distributed"
    safety: "Very High"
    analysis:
      zonal_isolation: "Fire / leak containment"
      selective_venting: true
      survivability: "Improved"
      bwb_compatibility: "Compatible with BWB volume distribution"
      boil_off_management: "Simplified hydrogen boil-off management"
      mass_trade_off: "+2–5% plumbing complexity"
      safety_gain: "Significant"

preliminary_selection:
  selected_option: "C"
  baseline_name: "Distributed Circular Cryogenic Cells"
  rationale:
    - "Aligned with ZNNN 600–699 hazard zoning"
    - "Aligned with modular propulsion architecture (500–599)"
    - "Deterministic isolation logic (5D system state s-dimension)"
