## Objective

Evaluate insulation concepts for circular cryogenic cells
comparing vacuum multi-layer insulation, foam, and hybrid
active cooling approaches for TRL, mass, maintainability,
and risk.

## Options Considered

| Option | Name | Type | TRL | Mass | Maintainability | Risk |
|--------|------|------|-----|------|-----------------|------|
| A | Vacuum + MLI | Passive | High | Medium | Medium | Low |
| B | Foam | Passive | Medium | High | High | Medium |
| C | Hybrid Active Cooling | Active | Low | High | Low | High |

## Preliminary Selection

**Selected Option:** A — Vacuum + MLI
**Baseline Name:** Vacuum + MLI

### Rationale

- Heritage from existing cryogenic systems
- Predictable boil-off modelling
