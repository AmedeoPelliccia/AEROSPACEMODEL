# GENESIS — Uncertainty Discovery Layer (26-00 General)

**ATA Section:** 26-00
**Purpose:** Capture and manage uncertainties before they enter the formal lifecycle

## Overview

GENESIS is the **pre-lifecycle uncertainty discovery layer** for section 26-00 (General). It captures unknowns that must be resolved before or during formal development.

## KNOT Types

### O-KNOTs (Origin Uncertainties)

Inherited or experience-gap uncertainties arising from the **integration of fire protection with hydrogen fuel systems**.

### Y-KNOTs (Derived Uncertainties)

Regulatory and requirement-driven unknowns from **SC-26-H2-001** and related special conditions for hydrogen fire protection.
