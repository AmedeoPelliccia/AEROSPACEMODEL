## Applicable Regulations

### EASA Part-M — Continuing Airworthiness Requirements
- **Subpart C (Airworthiness Review):** Weight and balance records must be current and maintained as part of the aircraft technical record.
- **Subpart E (Components):** Weighing equipment classified as ground support equipment (GSE) subject to calibration and maintenance controls.
- **Evidence required:** Calibrated weighing records, weight and balance reports signed by licensed engineer.

### FAA AC 43.13-1B — Acceptable Methods, Techniques, and Practices
- **Chapter 10 (Aircraft Weighing):** Defines acceptable weighing methods, tare corrections, and scale calibration requirements.
- **Evidence required:** Weighing report per AC 43.13-1B format, scale calibration certificates.

### CS-25 — Certification Specifications for Large Aeroplanes
- **CS 25.25 (Weight Limits):** Maximum take-off weight, maximum zero-fuel weight, and minimum weight to be verified by weighing.
- **CS 25.27 (Centre of Gravity Limits):** CG envelope to be confirmed by weight and balance report.
- **Evidence required:** Approved Weight and Balance Manual (WBM), individual aircraft weighing record.

### EASA Part-145 — Maintenance Organisation Approvals
- **145.A.40 (Equipment, tools and material):** Maintenance organisation must have access to calibrated weighing equipment sufficient for the aircraft type.
- **Evidence required:** MO capability list including weighing GSE, calibration records.

## Applicable Standards

### ISO 17025 — General Requirements for Testing and Calibration Laboratories
- **Scope:** Calibration traceability for weighing equipment.
- **Evidence required:** Calibration certificates traceable to national standards (BIPM chain), uncertainty budgets.

### OIML R 76 — Non-Automatic Weighing Instruments
- **Scope:** Performance requirements for platform scales used in aircraft weighing.
- **Evidence required:** Type-approval certificate, verification certificate, calibration interval log.

## Hydrogen-Specific Requirements ⭐

### NFPA 2 — Hydrogen Technologies Code
- **Section 7 (Indoor Storage and Use):** Weighing bays housing an LH₂-fuelled aircraft are classified as H₂ occupancy areas; forced ventilation, H₂ detection, and bonding/grounding are mandatory.
- **Evidence required:** Bay ventilation design approval, H₂ detector calibration records, electrical bonding inspection records.

### EASA Special Condition — Hydrogen Storage and Distribution (SC-28-H2-001)
- **Scope:** Weight and balance reports must account for LH₂ density at actual fuel temperature; nominal density (0.0709 kg/L at 20 K) must not be assumed without temperature correction.
- **Evidence required:** Approved LH₂ mass-correction procedure, recorded fuel temperature at time of weighing.
