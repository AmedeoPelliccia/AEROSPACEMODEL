## CS-10-001 — H₂ Parking Bay Pilot at Hydrogen-Ready Airport

**Context:** A European regional airport participating in the Clean Hydrogen Partnership (CHP) HyAirport programme retrofitted two widebody parking bays to support hydrogen-compatible aircraft during ground trials.

**Key Measures Implemented:**
- Zone 2 electrical classification with ATEX luminaires and GPU cables.
- Fixed H₂ electrochemical detection array (6 sensors per bay, all networked to airport safety management system).
- Forced ventilation upgrade from 6 ACH to 12 ACH with interlocked dampers.
- Boil-off recovery lines plumbed to an on-site H₂ compressor and storage tank.
- Bonding posts installed at nose-gear and main-gear positions with resistance-verified earthing.

**Outcome:** Hydrogen ground trials conducted over 6 months without safety incidents. Bay retrofit cost approximately €180,000 per bay; payback estimated at 3 years assuming commercial H₂ aircraft operations begin 2030.

**Lessons Learned:**
- ATEX electrical upgrade was the largest cost driver; plan for full electrical survey and certification before H₂ operations.
- Boil-off recovery integration with airport H₂ supply chain requires close coordination with O-OPERATIONS ATA IN H₂ GSE team.
- Training ground operations and maintenance crews on H₂ hazards required 8 h per person.

## CS-10-002 — RTS Workflow Optimisation After Scheduled Maintenance

**Context:** A large MRO organisation operating an EASA Part-145 facility analysed RTS cycle time after heavy maintenance checks. Average RTS time was 18 h from final task sign-off to aircraft release to flight operations.

**Root Cause of Delays:**
1. Covers and blanks count reconciliation (27% of total delay).
2. Multiple final inspection sign-offs not sequenced efficiently.
3. H₂ system isolation-valve verification not in standard RTS checklist.

**Improvements Implemented:**
1. RFID tagging of all covers and blanks; automated count reconciliation against aircraft-specific inventory list.
2. Digital RTS checklist with dependency-linked task sequencing.
3. H₂ isolation valve check added as mandatory RTS step with signed record.

**Outcome:** RTS cycle time reduced to 11 h (39% improvement). RFID tagging eliminated all cover-not-removed events over 18 months.

## CS-10-003 ⭐ — Extended Storage with LH₂ System Inerted (Concept)

**Context:** AMPEL360 Q100 aircraft entered into scheduled heavy maintenance or storage for > 30 days must have the LH₂ system defueled and inerted. This case study documents the proposed procedure and infrastructure.

**Proposed Infrastructure Requirements:**
1. LH₂ defueling pad adjacent to hangar (coordinate with O-OPERATIONS / H₂ GSE) with cryogenic drain and boil-off capture.
2. Nitrogen inerting station: portable GN₂ supply trolley with regulator and aircraft interface adapter.
3. Leak test infrastructure: helium or H₂ trace-gas test panel to verify inerting completeness.
4. Storage preservation record integrated into aircraft tech record and digital thread (`N-NEURAL_NETWORKS/D-DIGITAL_THREAD_TRACEABILITY/`).

**Status:** Procedure under development; planned for LC10 (Industrial & Supply Chain) phase validation.
