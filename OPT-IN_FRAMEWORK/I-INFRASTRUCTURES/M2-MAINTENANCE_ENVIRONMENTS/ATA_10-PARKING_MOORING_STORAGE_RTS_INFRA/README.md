# ATA 10 — Parking, Mooring, Storage, and RTS Infrastructure

**Domain:** I-INFRASTRUCTURES / M2-MAINTENANCE_ENVIRONMENTS  
**ATA Code:** 10I (Infrastructure variant of ATA 10)  
**Lifecycle Profile:** Standard  
**Novel Technology:** ⭐ Special Condition for H₂ aircraft parking and storage (boil-off, H₂ safety zones)

---

## Scope

This directory covers all ground-based infrastructure required to support **parking, mooring, storage, and return-to-service (RTS)** operations for the AMPEL360 Q100 aircraft. This includes apron and hangar parking positions, tie-down and mooring systems, aircraft storage environments, and the checks and infrastructure required to return aircraft to service after storage.

### Coverage

- Parking position design and markings (apron and hangar)
- Wheel chock and tie-down/mooring infrastructure
- Aircraft covers and protective equipment for storage
- Short-term parking facilities (line station)
- Long-term storage facility requirements
- RTS infrastructure and inspection capability
- **⭐ H₂ aircraft storage**: boil-off management, cryogenic tank pressure monitoring, H₂ safety zone requirements during storage
