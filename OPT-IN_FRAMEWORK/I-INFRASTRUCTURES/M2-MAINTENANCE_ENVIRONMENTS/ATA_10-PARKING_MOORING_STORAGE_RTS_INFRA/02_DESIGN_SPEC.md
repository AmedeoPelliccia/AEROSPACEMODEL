## Parking Bay Design

### Dimensions
- **Minimum bay width:** Wingspan + 7.5 m (3.75 m each side clearance) per ICAO Annex 14 Appendix 4 for Code E aircraft.
- **Minimum bay depth:** Aircraft length + 6 m.
- **Turning radius provision:** Clear area sufficient for tow vehicle with full AMPEL360 Q100 MTOW.

### Surface and Drainage
- **Surface:** Concrete or asphalt rated for AMPEL360 Q100 MTOW wheel loads; impermeable with fluid containment berm.
- **Drainage:** Oil-water separator on bay drain; capacity for hydraulic fluid, water, and LH₂ condensate collection.
- **Floor markings:** Aircraft centreline, wheel stop lines, safety exclusion zones per ICAO Annex 14 colour codes.

### Hydrogen Safety Bay Classification ⭐
- **Zone designation:** Zone 2 (IEC 60079-10-1) within 3 m of LH₂ vent ports at floor level.
- **Ventilation:** Forced ventilation ≥ 10 ACH; exhaust vented to safe outdoor discharge point (vent stack rated for H₂ concentration per NFPA 2 §7).
- **H₂ detection:** ≥ 4 fixed electrochemical sensors per bay; pre-alarm at 10% LEL, evacuation alarm at 25% LEL.
- **Bonding / earthing:** Bonding points at aircraft push-back position (nose-gear and main-gear); resistance ≤ 1 Ω.
- **Electrical:** All permanently installed electrical equipment within Zone 2 to be ATEX/IECEx certified.
- **Boil-off vent connection:** Bayonet or cam-lock connection on bay service panel for optional connection to boil-off recovery system (O-OPERATIONS / ATA IN H₂ GSE).

## Mooring System Design

### Tie-Down Load Requirements
- **Design load:** 1.5 × maximum gross weight for wind gust load per AMPEL360 Q100 AMM ATA 10 tie-down chapter.
- **LH₂ correction:** Tie-down design load calculated with full LH₂ tank mass included; density correction as per SC-28-H2-001.
- **Anchor pattern:** Per aircraft manufacturer's approved mooring diagram; minimum 8 anchor points (4 main-gear, 2 nose-gear, 2 tail/empennage).

### Anchor Infrastructure
- **Anchor type:** Steel flush-deck fittings rated per design load.
- **Spacing tolerance:** ±50 mm from mooring diagram dimensions.
- **Inspection interval:** Annual visual and load test.

## Ground Power Unit (GPU) Infrastructure
- **GPU capacity:** 28 VDC / 115 VAC 400 Hz output compatible with AMPEL360 Q100 external power requirements.
- **Cable protection:** GPU cables routed in trench covers to prevent trip hazard and FOD.
- **Standby interlock:** GPU power must be isolated before LH₂ fuelling operations begin (signage and interlock per NFPA 2).

---

## Storage Facility Design
- **Short-term storage (< 30 days):** Standard aircraft hangar with temperature range −20°C to +50°C; humidity ≤ 85% RH non-condensing.
- **Long-term storage (> 30 days):** Climate-controlled facility or approved preservation programme per AMPEL360 Q100 AMM ATA 10.
- **LH₂ system during storage:** LH₂ system to be defueled and inerted per LH₂ storage procedure before long-term storage entry.
