## Hydrogen-Specific Requirements ⭐

### NFPA 2 — Hydrogen Technologies Code
- **Section 7 (Indoor Fuelling Operations):** LH₂ fuelling in enclosed or semi-enclosed areas requires explosion-proof electrical classification, forced ventilation, H₂ detection, bonding/grounding, and no-ignition-source controls.
- **Evidence required:** Fuelling area classification design document, H₂ detector calibration records.

### ISO 14687-2 — Hydrogen Fuel Quality — Product Specification
- **Scope:** LH₂ supplied for fuelling must meet purity specification: > 99.97% H₂, CO < 0.2 ppm, CO₂ < 2 ppm, H₂O < 5 ppm, total hydrocarbons < 2 ppm.
- **Evidence required:** LH₂ Certificate of Analysis (CoA) per delivery, on-site spot-check records.

### EASA Special Condition SC-28-H2-001
- **Scope:** LH₂ fuelling couplings must be rated to −253 °C, pressure-rated for maximum tank fill pressure, and compatible with the approved ATA 28 system design.
- **Evidence required:** Coupling qualification test report, material compatibility certificate.

### EN 1626 — Valves for Cryogenic Service
- **Scope:** All cryogenic valves in the fuelling cart must be rated per EN 1626 at the appropriate operating temperature and pressure.
- **Evidence required:** EN 1626 compliance certificate, valve test records.
