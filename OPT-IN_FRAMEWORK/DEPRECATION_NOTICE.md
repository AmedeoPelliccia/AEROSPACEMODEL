# DEPRECATION NOTICE

**This directory (`OPT-IN_FRAMEWORK/`) has been superseded.**

The canonical path is now:

```
AMPEL360_Trans/PORT-INS_FRAMEWORK/
```

## Migration Status

The directory rename from `OPT-IN_FRAMEWORK/` → `AMPEL360_Trans/PORT-INS_FRAMEWORK/`
is in progress. All new content and the **S-SIMTEST_DIGITAL_TWIN** / **R-RESERVED**
axes are at the canonical path. This directory will be removed once the full
`git mv` migration is complete.

## Action Required (repository owner)

To complete the migration, run from the repository root:

```bash
git mv OPT-IN_FRAMEWORK AMPEL360_Trans/PORT-INS_FRAMEWORK_LEGACY
# Then merge/reconcile with existing AMPEL360_Trans/PORT-INS_FRAMEWORK/
```
