# N-NEURAL_NETWORKS Domain

**AI Governance, Traceability, Digital Product Passport, and Ledger Systems**

---

## Scope

The N-NEURAL_NETWORKS domain contains documentation for AI governance systems, traceability infrastructure, Digital Product Passport (DPP) systems, and distributed ledger technologies that support transparency, compliance, and lifecycle management across the aircraft.

## ATA Chapters

### ATA 96 – Traceability, DPP, and Ledger
**Digital Product Passport and Traceability Systems**

**Scope:**
- Digital Product Passport (DPP) implementation
- Aircraft lifecycle traceability
- Component and material traceability
- Supply chain transparency
- Distributed ledger technology (blockchain)
- Immutable audit trails
- Regulatory compliance tracking
- ESG data collection and reporting

**Key Functions:**
- Birth certificate for aircraft and major components
- End-to-end material and component traceability
- Maintenance history and configuration tracking
- Sustainability and circularity data
- Compliance evidence repository
- Integration with LC12/LC13 (MRO) systems
- Integration with LC14 (End of Life) for material recovery

**Standards and Compliance:**
- EU Digital Product Passport regulation
- ISO 15926 (Industrial data integration)
- ISO 14067 (Carbon footprint)
- Blockchain standards (if applicable)
- Data privacy regulations (GDPR, etc.)

**Lifecycle Integration:**
- LC01: DPP concept and governance framework
- LC02: DPP data requirements and interfaces
- LC04: DPP system design and integration
- LC08: DPP certification and compliance
- LC10: DPP production deployment
- LC11–LC14: Continuous DPP updates throughout operations and end of life

### ATA 97 – Reserved Program Slot
**Future AI Governance and Neural Network Systems**

**Status:** Reserved for future program-specific AI governance and neural network implementations.

**Potential Use Cases:**
- Program-specific AI governance frameworks
- Neural network model repositories
- AI ethics and compliance management
- Extended AI/ML capabilities beyond ATA 95
- Federated learning infrastructure
- AI model marketplace and licensing

## Integration with Other Domains

### Integration with I2-INTELLIGENCE (ATA 95)
- ATA 95 (I2): Operational AI/ML models on-board
- ATA 96 (N): AI model traceability and governance infrastructure
- **Relationship:** ATA 96 provides governance layer for ATA 95 models

### Integration with ESG (LC09)
- DPP (ATA 96) collects and reports ESG data
- Lifecycle assessment data integration
- Carbon footprint tracking
- Circularity metrics

### Integration with MRO (LC12/LC13)
- Maintenance history recorded in DPP
- Parts traceability for repair and overhaul
- Airworthiness compliance tracking

### Integration with End of Life (LC14)
- Material recovery tracking
- Recycling and disposal documentation
- DPP closure and final reporting

## Novel Technology Considerations

As a governance and infrastructure domain, N-NEURAL_NETWORKS supports novel technologies:
- **C2-CIRCULAR_CRYOGENIC_CELLS:** Hydrogen component traceability
- **I2-INTELLIGENCE:** AI model governance and traceability
- **P-PROPULSION:** Fuel cell component lifecycle tracking

---

## Lifecycle Applicability

DPP and traceability systems span the entire lifecycle:
- **LC01–LC10 (PLM):** DPP design, implementation, and initial data capture
- **LC11–LC13 (OPS):** Continuous DPP updates and operational data collection
- **LC14 (EOL):** DPP closure and final lifecycle reporting
